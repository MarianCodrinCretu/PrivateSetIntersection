Private Set Intersection is a project proposed by Lecturer Sorin Iftene, Ph.D., and coordinated by Professor Adrian Iftene, Ph.D. Its main scope is to implement a cryptographic technique that computes the intersection of two encrypted datasets without revealing any data, excepting the intersection content.
